# Analysis Report on Neural Network Model for Predicting Charity Outcomes

### Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to predict the success of charity applications using a neural network model. By leveraging historical data on past applications, the aim is to build a predictive model that can provide insights into the factors contributing to successful outcomes.

### Results

#### Data Preprocessing

* **Target Variable:**
  * `IS_SUCCESSFUL` (binary variable indicating whether an application was successful)
* **Features:**
  * `APPLICATION_TYPE`
  * `AFFILIATION`
  * `CLASSIFICATION`
  * `USE_CASE`
  * `ORGANIZATION`
  * `STATUS`
  * `INCOME_AMT`
  * `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`
  * `ASK_AMT`
* **Removed Variables:**
  * `EIN`
  * `NAME`

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
